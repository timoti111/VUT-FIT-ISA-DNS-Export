.SH NAME
dns-export \- captures DNS packets and creates statistics from them
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dns-export
[\fB\-h\fR]
[\fB\-r\fR \fIPCAP-FILE\fR]
[\fB\-i\fR \fIINTERFACE\fR]
[\fB\-s\fR \fISYSLOG-SERVER\fR]
[\fB\-t\fR \fISECONDS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dns-export
starts capturing packets from file or interface based on used options.
.br 
It uses pcap library for capturing packets from some interfce.
.br
If interface is set program is capturing packets in infinite loop,
.br
collects statistics and stops only if \fISIGINT\fR (Ctrl + C) signal is received.
.br
Statistics are sent to syslog server after x \fISECONDS\fR set with option \fB\-t\fR.
.br
If not set default value is 60 seconds. If syslog server is not set statistics are
.br
written to standard output by default. Statistics can be written to standard output
.br
even with signal \fISIGUSR1\fR. 
.br
If pcap file is set program parses all packets in this file collects statistics
.br
and sends them to syslog server if it is set. If not writes them to standard output.
.PP
\fISupported DNS answer types:\fR A, AAAA, CNAME, PTR, MX, NS, SOA, TXT, SPF, DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC, DS
.br
\fISupported lower layer protocols:\fR
.br
\fILink layer:\fR RAW packet, Linux cooked capture encapsulation, Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6
.br
\fINetwork layer:\fR IPv4 (fragmented too), IPv6 (fragmented too)
.br
\fITransport layer:\fR TCP (segmented too), UDP 
.PP
Fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets are supported and IPv6 extension headers are supported
.br
too except ESP header, which encrypts data in packet.
.br
Assembling of segmented TCP packets is supported also.
.br
Both TCP segmenting and IP fragenting collects data and assembles them if possible.
.SH OPTIONS

standard output if not.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B dns-export -r file.pcap
runs program to capture packets from file file.pcap and prints them to standard output.
.TP
.B dns-export -i eth0 -s 127.0.0.1 -t 5
runs program to capture packets from interface eth0 and sends statistics to server
.br
127.0.0.1 every 5 seconds
